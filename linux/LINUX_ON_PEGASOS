Linux on pegasos status overview
--------------------------------

There are three kinds of Linux support listed in the text below. Native
installers, image installers and live CDs. I will quickly give an explaination
of what is meant by these three terms.

  The native installer is support for the Pegasos from the installer of a
  given distribution. It makes it possible to install Linux for the Pegasos in
  a customized way, and may need more or less user intervention, depending on
  distribution used. The advantage is that you get to fully customize your
  installation the way you like, the disadvantage is that more work is needed.

  The image installer is used to install an already configured distribution.
  This is easier than a full custom installation, but you are saddled with the
  choices made by the image builder, and customization of the image is not
  really possible or rather restricted. The work done by the image_installer
  project should allow more customization.

  Live CDs are a CD containing an image, like the one used for the image
  installers, but which can be run directly from the CD, without needing to
  install anything on the harddisk. It is cool for unintrusive testing and for
  people without a lot of harddisk space. They have the same customization
  problems as the installed images though, even a bit worse, since the
  customization needs to be redone each time. They usually sport advanced
  hardware recognition to compensate for this.

0) Generic Linux stuff

  The main site for my Linux kernel work can be found on :

  http://people.debian.org/~luther/pegasos

  There is also an alioth project :

  http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pegasos/

  But it is currently not used.

  The people.debian.org address is also mirrored on the Genesi ftp site at :

  ftp://zargos.morphos.net/linux/2.4.22 (needing login/password though)

  And on :

  http://www.pegasos.co.nz/linux

  Current situation is that kernel 2.4.22 works fine on Pegasos, with a small
  patch available at the first site, which should for the most part be
  integrated into 2.4.23. Work on 2.6.0 test kernels has not begun, but it
  should be quick once there is a successful report on another powerpc
  subarch.

1) Debian Woody

  Debian Woody uses the so-called debian boot-floppies as installer, they are
  not really floppies, since it is possible to install them from a CD-ROM or
  from the net. Furthermore the floppy install method on Pegasos is not
  really all that useful, since the root.bin is too big, and the Pegasos OF
  cannot boot from the floppy disk anyway. Installation has been tested from
  both the network and from the official woody CD set (7 binary CDs).

  The boot floppies installer comes localised in various languages. Currently
  built-in and translated languages are : en pt de pl fr es ja sv

2) Debian Sarge

  Debian Sarge, which is not yet released, will use the new debian-installer,
  which is not yet finished. I have a booting kernel+initrd image, but there
  is still much work to be done before it is functional.

3) PegXLin

  PegXLin is a one CD installed image of debian/woody. It uses part of the
  debian/woody installer, but then uses an installer script that copies the
  pegxlin pre-installed image to the disk.

4) Image_installer

  Image_installer is similar in concept to the PegXLin. It currently supports
  a Mandrake 9.1 image, work on a YellowDog image is underway and PegXLin is
  also planned, maybe it will even come to a merging of these two concepts.
  Gentoo and Suze were also rumored to be planned in the future.
  Image_installer for Mandrake 9.1 has also some Pegasos specific kernel
  modules and maybe XFree86 driver configuration.

5) Gentoo

  Gentoo is a source distribution, it is distinct from the other distributions
  in that you have to recompile everything yourself.
  Gentoo doesn't support the Pegasos natively yet, but you will work with the
  stuff available at :

  http://dev.gentoo.org/~dholm/ppc.html

  When they release 2.4.22 kernel sources, it will come with support for the
  Pegasos, using the same patches as i have.

  http://www.gentoo.org/
  
  There is also a Gentoo Live CD available for powerpc.

  http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-ppc-install.xml
  http://ds.thn.htu.se/linux/gentoo/releases/ppc/1.4/livecd

  The live CD won't boot on pegasos without the above mentioned pegasos
  kernel, but this may change in the future. The recomended isos would be the
  livecd-g3-grp-1.4-cd1.iso, or the cd2 if you don't want to rebuild
  everything, as the cd2 contains pre-built binaries for the g3. [but then, you
  could as well use a binary distro, like debian. Sven@debian speaking :)))]

6) Zynot

  <I have no information on it>

7) Debian/Knoppix ppc Live CD.

  There is also a Debian/Knoppix Live CD available for Powerpc. This is the
  one that Nicholas Blachford spoke about in his LinuxTag report, altough it
  does only contain a powermac kernel right now. I suppose it should work fine
  with a Pegasos-aware kernel like the vmlinuz-2.4.22, not sure though.
